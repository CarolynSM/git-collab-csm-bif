        I really like papayas. Carolyn lived with a woman in Bolivia and she would inhale this papaya jam that the woman would make. She used a scale to make it. She would mix the papaya with an equal weight of sugar in the pot so as to avoid using pectin. Some fruits have pectin in them, like papaya maybe.
