## Workflow:

Carolyn will own the repo and Patrick will make requests, mostly becuase Carolyn is the queen.

### Task 1 - Carolyn

You should create an array of objects. Each object should have a name and age.

### Task 2 - Patrick

You should create an array of numbers in a Javascript file, if there isn't one. Write a function that generates a sum.
